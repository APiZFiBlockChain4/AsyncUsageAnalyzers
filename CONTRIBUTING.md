# Contributing

1. To start working on a diagnostic, add a comment to the issue indicating you are working on implementing it.

2. Add a new issue for a code fix for the diagnostic. For example, I added DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers#171 when I
   worked on DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers#6. Even if no code fix is possible, the issue is a place for discussions
   regarding possible corrections. Code fixes may, but do not have to be implemented alongside the diagnostic.

3. If a diagnostic or code fix is submitted without tests, it might be rejected. However, it may be accepted provided
   all of the following are true:

   1. The code is disabled by default, by passing `AnalyzerConstants.DisabledNoTests` for the `isEnabledByDefault`
      parameter when creating the `DiagnosticDescriptor`. It will be enabled by default only after tests are in place.
   2. A new issue was created for implementing tests for the item (e.g. DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers#176).
   3. Evidence was given that the feature is currently operational, and the code appears to be a solid starting point
      for other contributors to continue the implementation effort.
